WEATHER CLIENT
======

A sample Android app which showcases common open source libraries.
The App tries to use a clean OOP structure that's focused on tests, the first design decision was 
to take divide the app in two big components `data` & `ui`, the first one contains all the data 
suppliers like http, or components to save images, the main reason for this to exist is based on the 
`Repository Pattern`.
 
The UI components are based on the `MVP` pattern without using the same names, where a `Source` is 
a components that provides the data for a UI trough the `View` and the `Repositories` handles the 
way of retains and gets the data. 

This project doesn't contains any comments because it tries to be self-commented, this approach 
encourages that the code is the documentation and it requires to be updated as it evolves.

cleaned in the organization of the project and somo separation of concepts in some classes that are 
doing to much

5.  What part was unclear? I think was pretty clear
